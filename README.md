Program for reading Coretemp and GPU-Z reports.

At work we use CoreTemp and GPU-Z to diagnose overheating on users PCs. But reading of reports terrible: we used Notepad or Excel for watching csv-files.
This program parse report files and displays information by graphycs.
In this program I added drag-n-drop and zip-archives autoextracting functionality at first time.
